# Issues
To open an issue without being tagged as "skill issue", you'll need:
- A clear description of what you're trying to do.
- Expected outcome and the real outcome with the full traceback.
- Solutions that you tried.
- Verify that it's not all of your fault (or else skill issue)

# Code formatting
- Follow PEP8 for Python code.
- Run linters like `flake8` and `black` to check code quality.
- Add type hints where appropriate.

# Making changes
- Please write the commit message in Present Simple tense.
- The commit message should be the summary of all the changes made, for example: "Add commenting and fix code formatting"
- Don't make changes where it affects the whole code structure unless it's really needed.
- Add an extended description for the list of all changes made, optional but needed for large commits. Example:
  ```
  Add commenting using the client's login session and fix code formatting in gd.py because notanerd used 2 charcter indents instead of 4. (I'm sick of this guy)
  ```
